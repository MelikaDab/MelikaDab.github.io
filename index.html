            <p>Hi, my name is Melika and this is my cozy little corner of the internet.</p>
            <p>I'm a junior computer science student who just transferred from Santa Barbara City College.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Iran and in fact lived there my entire life - until 2 years ago. Some find that surprising because of my accent (or lack thereof)!</p>
            <p>I am very spiritual and get a lot of my philosphy on life from famous - long passed - Persian poets.<br>
               I find <strong>Rumi</strong>'s poetry especially enlightening and am so grateful to be able to enjoy it in its raw, <em>untranslated</em> form.
